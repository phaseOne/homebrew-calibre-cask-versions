# calibre-cask-versions
Here you'll find older versions of Calibre for installation with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## How do I install an old release of Calibre?

```
brew install phaseone/calibre-cask-versions/<formula>
```

Replace `<formula>` with a major release of Calibre. e.g. `brew install phaseone/calibre-cask-versions/calibre4` will install the `4.23.0` release of Calibre.

Or `brew tap phaseone/calibre-cask-versions` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).

## Contributing
For this tap repo, I've included the latest minor version of legacy versions of Calibre. If you'd like to see a version here other than those included, please submit a PR with the formula and rationale for its inclusion.
